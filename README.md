- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SocomTedd
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Unreal Engine 5 as a hobby _but who knows where hobbies can lead you?_ :)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning by creating a bunch of quick, small games using Blueprints to get my head around game development again after a 10 year break after university.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a degree in computer games programming but have never worked in the games industry despite being employed as a software developer for over a decade.
